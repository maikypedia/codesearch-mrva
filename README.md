# Github Code Search + MRVA CodeQL
This tool serves to create a list of repositories that utilize the methods specified by the user, which can then be used in CodeQL MRVA (Multi-Repository Variant Analysis). By enabling users to specify the specific methods they are interested in, this tool allows for targeted repository selection based on their research criteria.
